# Network Fundamentals for Cybersecurity

## Overview
This repository documents my learning of core networking fundamentals through hands-on
TryHackMe labs. The goal is to understand how networks actually function at a technical level
and why strong fundamentals are essential in cybersecurity.

Rather than memorizing tools or commands, this work focuses on how data moves through
networks, where failures occur, and how those failures impact security and reliability.

## Why Networking Matters in Cybersecurity
Most security tools depend on correct network behavior.
If Layer 2 or Layer 3 communication is misunderstood or misconfigured, visibility is lost
and security controls become ineffective.

Understanding networking helps with:
- Traffic analysis and monitoring
- Incident investigation
- Network segmentation and trust boundaries
- Identifying misconfigurations and attack paths

## What I Learned

### Local Area Networks (LANs)
A LAN is a group of devices communicating directly at Layer 2 using MAC addresses.
Switches forward frames based on MAC address tables, not IP addresses.

If communication fails at this level, higher layers cannot compensate.

### Frames vs Packets
Frames operate at Layer 2 and use MAC addresses.
Packets operate at Layer 3 and use IP addresses.

Frames are rebuilt at every hop, while packets persist end-to-end.
Understanding this distinction prevents incorrect assumptions about traffic flow.

### Layered Networking (OSI Model)
Networks are built using layers, each with a specific responsibility.
Failures at lower layers cascade upward and often appear as “complex” problems.

Strong fundamentals reduce troubleshooting time and prevent common mistakes.

### Extending a Network
When a network grows beyond a single LAN, routing, segmentation, and trust boundaries
become necessary.

Larger networks increase complexity and attack surface, making intentional design critical.
